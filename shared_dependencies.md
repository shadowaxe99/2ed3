Shared Dependencies:

1. Function Names: `send_email` and `track_response` are the main functions that will be implemented in the `functions.py` file and tested in the `test_functions.py` file. These function names will also be referenced in the documentation files.

2. Third-party Email Service Provider's SDK or API: The chosen email service provider's SDK or API will be integrated into the `functions.py` file. The setup and usage of this SDK or API will be documented in the `design_document.md`, `api_documentation.md`, and `guidelines_and_best_practices.md` files.

3. Firestore Database: The Firestore database will be used to store response data in the `functions.py` file. The schema of this data and the process of storing it will be documented in the `design_document.md` and `api_documentation.md` files.

4. Email Content Personalization: The process of personalizing email content based on brand and influencer data will be implemented in the `send_email` function in the `functions.py` file and documented in the `design_document.md`, `api_documentation.md`, and `guidelines_and_best_practices.md` files.

5. Response Tracking: The process of tracking and recording brand responses will be implemented in the `track_response` function in the `functions.py` file and documented in the `design_document.md`, `api_documentation.md`, and `guidelines_and_best_practices.md` files.

6. Unit Tests: Unit tests for the `send_email` and `track_response` functions will be written in the `test_functions.py` file. The process of running these tests and interpreting the results will be documented in the `api_documentation.md` and `guidelines_and_best_practices.md` files.

7. Documentation: The `README.md` file will provide an overview of the email automation and response tracking features. The `design_document.md`, `api_documentation.md`, and `guidelines_and_best_practices.md` files will provide detailed documentation of these features, including their design, API, usage guidelines, and best practices.
